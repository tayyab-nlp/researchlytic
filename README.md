## ⚠️ Platform Limitations & Considerations

### 📊 **Data-Based Nature**
- **Metadata-Driven**: Analysis is based on published research metadata, not live tracking
- **Publication Lag**: Recent research may have 3-6 month delays before appearing in databases
- **Coverage Gaps**: Some niche journals or non-English publications may have limited representation

### 🔄 **Update Frequency**
- **Not Real-Time**: Data reflects published research, not ongoing studies or preprints
- **Periodic Updates**: Database refreshes occur regularly but not instantaneously
- **Citation Delays**: Citation metrics may lag behind actual citation patterns

### 🎯 **Scope Considerations**
- **Published Research Only**: Unpublished studies, ongoing research, or grey literature not included
- **Language Bias**: Primarily English-language publications, though multilingual sources included
- **Database Coverage**: Results limited to publications indexed in available academic databases

### 💡 **Best Use Practices**
- **Trend Analysis**: Excellent for understanding historical trends and patterns
- **Strategic Planning**: Ideal for medium to long-term research planning
- **Complement Other Sources**: Best used alongside other research intelligence tools
- **Historical Context**: Most reliable for analyzing established research fields (2+ years of data)
